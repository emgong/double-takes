          h2 So, about that page #[br.sm] you asked for.
          p.
            Our server can't find the page you navigated to. Sorry! Remember
            when we said #[a(href="//testdouble.com/agency") software was broken]?
            It turns out, bugs happen even to the best of us!
          p.
            No one likes landing at a
            #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404") 404]
            page (especially a cheeky one like this), so hopefully we can
            quickly send you on your way. Perhaps you meant to get to:
          ul
            li #[a(href="//testdouble.com/agency") A bit about our agency]
            li #[a(href="//blog.testdouble.com") Our blog]
            li #[a(href="//testdouble.com/work") A description of our work]
            li #[a(href="//blog.testdouble.com/archive") Our blog archive]
            li #[a(href="https://github.com/testdouble") Some of our open source]
            li #[a(href="https://vimeo.com/testdouble") Our conference talks]
          p.
            Or maybe you were just curious what on earth a "test double" is and
            wound up at our homepage looking for a definition. If that's the
            case, you might check
              #[a(href="https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/Test-Double") this]
            or #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_double") that] wiki
            page.

          h2 We're only as strong #[br.sm] as our weakest ðŸ”—.

            If you think you arrived here via a broken link, we'd love if you
            could help us by letting us know where you found it by
            #[a(href="mailto:hello+404@testdouble.com") e-mail] or
            #[a(href="https://twitter.com/testdouble") twitter] and we'll do
            our best to fix it quickly. ðŸ’š
