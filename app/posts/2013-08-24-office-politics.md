**Update 2013-12-01: video updated to the version recorded at Madison Ruby 2013; the Kalamazoo X video is still embedded at the bottom of this post.**

I did a presentation about how developers can start to dip their toes in the water of effecting change in their teams and organizations based on my experiences as a consultant navigating highly-charged political environments.

In addition to the [video above](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfK0rTacde8
), here's a copy of the slides as I presented them at [Madison Ruby](http://madisonruby.org):
