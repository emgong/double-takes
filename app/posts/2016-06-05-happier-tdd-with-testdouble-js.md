[NodeConf Oslo 2016](http://oslo.nodeconf.com) on June 4th, 2016.

## Test-driven development is a soft skill

The purpose of this talk is to give a quick, light-on-its-feet introduction to
an unorthodox discipline of test-driven development ("TDD") that I've termed
"Discovery Testing".

You may enjoy the content of this talk if:

* you're interested in
[testdouble.js](https://github.com/testdouble/testdouble.js), but don't want to
start by diving into its relatively exhausting
[documentation](https://github.com/testdouble/testdouble.js/tree/master/docs)
* you're familiar with TDD and for whatever reason didn't have a tremendously
positive experience with it
* you've ever been confused by styles of testing that make heavy use of test
doubles (e.g. mock objects)
