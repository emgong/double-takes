The [video above](https://vimeo.com/testdouble/under-pressure) was recorded at
[Agile and Beyond 2017](http://agileandbeyond.com/2017/) earlier this month.

Itâ€™s an accepted truth in software development; when deadlines loom the team will be pressured to GO FASTER. Unable to convince management of the risks, we resign to cutting corners and working longer hours. Unfortunately the result is just as predictable, a short spike in velocity and many delays to come.

This talk is an exploration of how to reverse the velocity spiral by building high trust relationships with management. We'll discuss root causes of our distrust like estimation, communication, and abuse of power so that the team can resist short sighted solutions that will plague them for years to come.
