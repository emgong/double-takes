### Your mission
100,000 simultaneous users.  38 days.  9 systems.  One launch.  Ready?

### Are you sure you want to do this?
* What is it like to go from zero users to **all the users** in one day?  How do you
prepare for that?
* Have you ever dealt with perfomance problems in systems you don't control?
* Have you ever negotiated a large-scale test with an external partner?
* Have you built an AWS architecture with the biggest possible pieces?
* Have you ever DDoSed your own site?
* Have you ever lost sleep because your application won't horizontally scale?

### Can't back out now
This is the story of a real-life product "land rush". It starts with designing a
load test, picking tools, and isolating a slew of dependencies. That's the easy
part. The fun really starts when the load test runs. Hold on tight and we'll
ride this swarm to the finish line.
