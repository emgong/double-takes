The [video above](https://vimeo.com/testdouble/business-q-and-a) was recorded
at [RailsConf 2018](https://www.railsconf.com) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It
attempts to answer 12 questions we received from the development community about
starting and scaling your own business.

We're the first to admit that we don't know everything about creating and
running your own company. It's true, we've managed to keep the (remote) lights
on at [Test Double](https://testdouble.com/agency) for over six years, but we
attribute most of what we've learned to others who have helped us along the way.
We've received phenomenal mentorship from business leaders we deeply respect.
We've read—well, Todd has read—lots of books on sales and management. And our
roles as consultants have given us front row seats to a lot of the challenges
that business leaders face.

All told, we want people to take away one thing: running a business is hard, but
it isn't rocket science. Our goal is to demystify the aspects that  we wish we
others had told us before we started the company. In the near future, we hope to
also share additional answers to some of the other questions we received in
the run-up to this talk that we didn't have time to include in a 40 minute
presentation format. Stay tuned!

If you enjoy the talk, please share it with your friends and colleagues! If
anything in the talk piques your interest, we'd [love to hear from
you](https://testdouble.com/contact), too!
