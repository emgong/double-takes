This talk takes a step back from the toolbox to ask:  What are the core benefits
a tool should provide?

As a project grows up, it has different needs and benefits from differing levels
of "discipline".  Likewise, people have differing comfort levels for process
rigor.

Too often we focus on the laundry list of benefits that we might get from a
tool without considering the maturity of our project or the composition of the
team. We want to build shared understanding without dictating a process that
crushes diverse thought and collaboration.

This talk proposes examples as a universal way to build shared understanding
without tying a team to specific tools or implementations.
