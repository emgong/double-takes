Our interview processes tend to focus solely on one outcome: a successful hire. But what about all of the other people who go through our interview process? If we aren't thinking about them and empathizing with their situations, we are prone to giving out lots of bad experiences. Let's focus on every candidate who goes through our interview process and create great outcomes for everyone.

The inspiration for this talk came from [Sam Jones' excellent talk of the same name](http://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2017-01-27-a-better-technical-interview).
