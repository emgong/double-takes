[Justin](http://twitter.com/searls) and I were honored to co-present at Rubyconf this year in New Orleans. Our goal was to rediscover what drew people to Ruby in the years before we joined the community. In that process, we dug up a ton of resources that we'd like to share. We didn't have enough time to share all of the amazing things we found, so we recommend going through this list. Some things may be repeats for you while some may be new. Our hope is that we can will continue to celebrate our history and not forget lessons from the past.

_Note: Items mentioned in our talk will be listed first in each facet._
