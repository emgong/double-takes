[Justin](http://twitter.com/searls) and I were honored to co-present at Rubyconf
this year in New Orleans. Our goal was to rediscover what drew people to Ruby in
the years before we joined the community. In the talk, we shared a bunch of
talks and blog posts from other Rubyists in the past, and this post shares all
of those links here, in the order that they appeared, starting with [Chris
Wanstrath's Ruby Hoedown 2008
Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVs90EsAi3o)
