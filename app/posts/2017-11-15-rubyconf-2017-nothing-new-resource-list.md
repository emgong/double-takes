[Justin](http://twitter.com/searls) and I were honored to co-present [this
presentation](https://vimeo.com/testdouble/nothing-new) at Rubyconf 2017 in New
Orleans. Our goal was to rediscover what drew people to Ruby in the years before
we joined the community. In the talk, we shared a bunch of talks and blog posts
from other Rubyists in the past, and this post shares all of those links here,
in the order that they appeared, starting with [Chris Wanstrath's Ruby Hoedown

## Transcript

The transcript of the talk follows:

<pre class="transcript">
[00:00] - Alright, this presentation is titled
[00:02] There's Nothing New Under the Sun.
[00:05] It is the first in a track, a three-part track
[00:09] that you are experiencing called The Future of Ruby.
[00:11] So let's hear a little bit about Ruby's future.
[00:14] - In the future
[00:16] (audience laughing)
[00:17] Ruby will become more popular.
[00:20] There will be more implementations, and there will be
[00:23] more programmers using it.
[00:25] More machines with it installed by default,
[00:28] and more people writing blogs about it.
[00:30] There will also be more people reading blogs about it.
[00:34] I know this is getting crazy but, you have
[00:36] to trust me because I'm keynoting.
[00:38] (audience laughing)
[00:40] So that was 2008, Ruby Hoedown, Chris Wanstrath,
[00:42] the CEO of GitHub, telling us a little bit
[00:44] about what the future would be like.
[00:46] This presentation is the future of Ruby,
[00:48] Part One, The Past.
[00:50] (audience laughing)
[00:52] And at the heart of all of my talks that
[00:54] I present to Ruby conferences, I'm asking the question
[00:57] why do we choose Ruby?
[00:58] I feel like we need to constantly
[01:01] reevaluate this and justify it and come up
[01:03] with good answers, and to be honest,
[01:05] that answer has evolved over time.
[01:07] For example, if it was before 1998,
[01:09] odds are you knew Japanese.
[01:12] If you picked up Ruby in '98,
[01:13] you were literally Dave Thomas.
[01:15] (audience laughing)
[01:17] Not that Dave Thomas, mind you, for the younger people,
[01:19] no, the one that wrote the Pragmatic Programmer
[01:21] with Andy Hunt.
[01:23] If you came in before 2005, you're probably
[01:24] really into Extreme Programming
[01:26] like test-driven development.
[01:28] In 2005, it was all about Rails, as was 2008 and 2012.
[01:33] (audience laughing)
[01:34] And if you're learning Ruby today for the first time,
[01:37] it's probably because your manager was
[01:39] a big fan of Rails back in their day.
[01:40] (audience laughing)
[01:43] But that oversimplifies things a little bit,
[01:44] so I'll share some of my perspective.
[01:46] I came to Ruby first in 2005.
[01:49] I was working through Kent Beck's Extreme Programming book,
[01:52] learning test driven development and loving it.
[01:54] I was writing a lot of Java, or I should say,
[01:56] I was writing a lot of XML and curly braces
[01:58] and not getting a lot done.
[02:00] I was also writing a lot of PHP and slinging
[02:02] thousands of lines of code that I had no hope
[02:04] of maintaining.
[02:05] And I studied in Japan that year,
[02:07] and I genuinely, like, my Japanese friends
[02:08] were really excited about the worldwide notoriety
[02:11] that this little programming language
[02:12] called Ruby was gaining.
[02:14] But if I ask the same thing about somebody in 2017,
[02:16] like, why do they choose Ruby nowadays?
[02:18] I mean, PHP has a perfectly suitable web framework.
[02:22] Java does as well.
[02:24] Microsoft with .NET has embraced open source
[02:27] all of a sudden, and even the Mac.
[02:30] To most people, if you wanna teach them how
[02:31] to program, they're being handed Node and React
[02:33] by default as opposed to Rails these days.
[02:36] Elixir and Elm kind of have a lot of the mojo,
[02:38] the new hotness.
[02:39] If you wanna do functional, you can do backend
[02:41] and frontend Clojure.
[02:42] PLT nerds love Rust, and some people use Go.
[02:46] (audience laughing) (applause)
[02:50] So, this talk is really a retrospective.
[02:53] I wanna talk about the things that drew people
[02:54] to Ruby originally, cause if we rediscover that,
[02:57] it'll help orient us about
[02:59] where we wanna take Ruby from here.
[03:01] But honestly, that sounded like a lot of work.
[03:03] There's over 2100 Ruby talks on Confreaks alone.
[03:08] And soon this is gonna be one of them.
[03:11] And I frankly, I just needed some help,
[03:12] so as an employer, I pulled a Mystery Science Theater 3000
[03:16] move, and locked one of my colleagues in a room
[03:18] for three months to do nothing but watch Ruby talks.
[03:22] His name is Josh Greenwood, and he came to Ruby
[03:25] a little later, in like 2012.
[03:26] And at that point, Rails was the default web framework
[03:29] choice in the industry.
[03:31] In a lot of ways, we'd reached a point
[03:33] of maturity with Sandi's object-oriented design book
[03:36] getting a lot of steam and attention.
[03:38] That was also right after Rails shipped the asset pipeline,
[03:41] which solved the problem of JavaScript packaging
[03:44] once and for all.
[03:45] (audience laughing)
[03:46] And it was also the height of the great coupon wars,
[03:49] where everyone I knew who practiced Ruby worked at either
[03:52] Groupon or LivingSocial,
[03:53] if they didn't already work at GitHub.
[03:57] So I'd like to welcome Josh up to the stage.
[03:59] (applause)
[04:05] - Thank you so much for having me.
[04:07] So let me tell you a little bit
[04:08] about my very naive plan.
[04:10] So I thought maybe I'd just go back
[04:11] and watch RubyConf videos from the first couple
[04:13] years of RubyConf.
[04:14] What Justin failed to tell me is they didn't actually
[04:15] start recording those until 2007.
[04:18] So that was a bummer.
[04:19] So I thought, "well, maybe I'll go check out
[04:20] "some early versions of Ruby
[04:22] "and see if I can get those to compile."
[04:24] That did not go well for me at all. (laughs)
[04:27] So then I thought, I was getting frustrated,
[04:28] I thought, "well, where's the internet store
[04:30] "all of its most valuable knowledge?"
[04:31] Well, Twitter, of course.
[04:33] So I thought, "maybe I'll go see what DHH
[04:35] was talking about when he first announced Rails."
[04:38] Yeah, so you might be thinking to yourself,
[04:40] "Josh, Twitter was not around back then."
[04:42] And you would be totally right.
[04:44] (audience laughing)
[04:46] So I was clearly missing some of the context
[04:48] of the things that came before me.
[04:49] And I suspect some of the room might be as well.
[04:52] So today my goal is to share some of the blog posts,
[04:54] the talks, the exercises, and the conversations
[04:57] we had with folks in the Ruby community,
[04:59] try to unearth some of what drew people
[05:01] to Ruby in the first place.
[05:02] - Cause our goal, really, is to reflect
[05:05] on these various facets of what made us all
[05:07] fall in love with Ruby and its community
[05:10] and to make it just the awesome language
[05:12] ecosystem that it is, so that we can think hard
[05:15] about what we wanna do to take it forward.
[05:17] But as a result, this talk is not an entree.
[05:20] We're not gonna be up here with some big rhetoric
[05:22] trying to convince you of something.
[05:23] Rather, these are mere appetizers
[05:25] showing you some of Josh and my favorite talks
[05:28] and blog posts and ideas from the past,
[05:32] hoping to get you to engage with those, too.
[05:34] And so please don't fret over all
[05:36] of the individual URLs and stuff
[05:38] and trying to take a picture of the screen or something.
[05:40] We're gonna post to our blog right after the talk
[05:43] sources of every single thing that we reference.
[05:45] So just keep an eye out for that later today.
[05:49] All right, without any further ado, let's sit back,
[05:51] and Josh, show me what you got.
[05:53] - So let's start at RubyConf Orlando in 2008.
[05:55] Matz is speaking.
[05:58] - Why we choose Ruby?
[06:00] And everyone has theories on independent reasons
[06:03] for choosing Ruby.
[06:05] For me, it's very simple.
[06:07] It is my beloved masterpiece, you know?
[06:09] (audience laughing)
[06:11] Why we choose Ruby, just because Ruby on Rails.
[06:14] (audience laughing)
[06:17] Could you raise your hand if you're going
[06:19] to stay in Ruby on Rails
[06:21] and not interested in Ruby itself?
[06:25] No, yes, this is Ruby Conference.
[06:28] Love is a great power behind Ruby.
[06:32] And it is the very reason behind Ruby, I'd argue.
[06:39] And I love people using Ruby.
[06:41] And I love people who love Ruby.
[06:44] And I love you all.
[06:49] - So Matz said that this acronym embarrasses him.
[06:53] But MINASWAN, Matz Is Nice And So We Are Nice,
[06:57] was so important to the Ruby community as it became today.
[07:01] He set the tone as the language designer.
[07:03] You don't see very many language designers
[07:05] give keynotes like that, right?
[07:07] But that kind and welcoming spirit
[07:09] is one of my favorite things about Ruby.
[07:12] - Let's jump to Scotland RuyConf in 2011.
[07:15] Our friend Chad Fowler's speaking here.
[07:19] - Who here is in the service industry?
[07:24] All right, actually you're all in the service industry.
[07:27] So everyone who didn't raise your hand, you're wrong.
[07:28] Everyone who was sitting next to them,
[07:31] give them a funny look.
[07:34] Our jobs are to be like an adventure tour guide
[07:37] for our customers, so take them into these scary places,
[07:40] allow them to feel the thrill of whatever
[07:42] it happens to be that we're doing,
[07:44] not to treat them like idiots and make them
[07:47] stay in like a rubberized room
[07:50] so they can't mess anything up,
[07:52] but to allow them to get as close as they want
[07:54] to the edge, and make it safe for them to do that.
[07:58] Other thing that everyone else is mentioning
[08:00] in this conference is Corey Haines.
[08:02] (audience laughing)
[08:04] Here's a tweet that Corey did recently.
[08:07] "Contemplating what practices could constitute
[08:09] "a list of required practices of modern
[08:10] "software development."
[08:12] So you're probably all thinking unit testing, right?
[08:15] And source control, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[08:17] Justin Gatelyn says, "giving a shit,
[08:20] "actually, really giving a shit,
[08:22] "knowing the first thing about coding,"
[08:24] and then, "giving a shit."
[08:26] (audience laughing)
[08:27] And I thought, "that is pretty deep."
[08:28] (audience laughing)
[08:32] He said a Lexus dealership was his best experience,
[08:35] which was not all that helpful,
[08:36] so I said, "in what way?"
[08:38] And he said this: "the feeling that they do
[08:40] "10 minutes of work to save you one minute of your time."
[08:46] And then I think the most important piece
[08:50] of this caring like crazy goal that I have
[08:55] in my new job and therefore in my new life here
[08:59] is to kill cynicism wherever I can.
[09:05] But rather than be cynical about that stuff,
[09:07] why don't you just fix it?
[09:09] Cynicism is laziness.
[09:12] Speaking of Dave, in The Pragmatic Programmer,
[09:14] Dave and Andy have one of their little snippets,
[09:17] I think they call them tips, that says,
[09:19] "always answer every email that you get,"
[09:22] which kinda sounds stupid.
[09:23] Like, is that really a bullet
[09:24] and one of the major headings in The Pragmatic Programmer,
[09:28] the classic, the computer programming classic?
[09:30] And it is.
[09:31] And the funny thing is, that might be
[09:32] the only one I can remember, having read it 10 years ago.
[09:36] I remember thinking it was weird, though,
[09:37] when I first read it.
[09:38] But it's such great advice.
[09:40] And when you're someone like Dave,
[09:43] he did answer my email, you know?
[09:45] In fact, I think that's why I emailed him,
[09:47] because I knew he was going to answer it.
[09:49] (audience laughing)
[09:52] - So we emailed Dave Thomas.
[09:54] (audience laughing)
[09:56] We asked, "what was the early Ruby community like
[09:59] "in the West?"
[10:01] He said, "well, there was a mailing list.
[10:02] "It was mostly in Japanese, but English speakers
[10:04] "were encouraged to post, too, and folks would reply.
[10:06] "Often we found ourselves communicating
[10:08] "purely through code.
[10:09] "Someone would post a broken test,
[10:11] "and one of the maintainers would either correct
[10:12] "the test or correct Ruby.
[10:15] "I started by asking Matz's permission to write the book.
[10:18] "He was enthusiastic and helped an incredible amount,
[10:20] "answering hundreds of questions
[10:21] "and occasionally changing the language
[10:22] "or libraries as I found edge cases."
[10:25] That book, by the way, is the PickAxe book.
[10:27] And if you haven't seen it, this was an indispensable
[10:30] API reference and guide for anyone
[10:32] using Ruby through the mid-oughts.
[10:35] "The book was published at the end of '99
[10:36] "and led to the first international Ruby Conference
[10:38] "the following year in Florida.
[10:40] "There were 30 to 40 people there,
[10:41] "including folks from Japan and Europe."
[10:44] So the moral of the story is that
[10:47] if you ever need help, just email Dave Thomas.
[10:49] And he'll reply to you.
[10:51] - Let's jump to 2007.
[10:53] Ryan Bates had just started producing RailsCasts.
[10:55] He basically got me through my first job.
[10:59] (computer keys clicking)
[11:07] - [Ryan] Well, this is where Rails 2.0
[11:09] comes in really handy, because you get
[11:11] this new rake task called db:create.
[11:14] And this will create the database
[11:16] for the current environment.
[11:19] - [Man] Whoa!
[11:20] (audience laughing)
[11:21] - [Ryan] There's a lot of fancy new additions
[11:22] to migrations in Rails 2, which will really
[11:25] save us a lot of time.
[11:28] Also, this t.timestamps here,
[11:31] what this will do is add a created at
[11:33] and updated at columns to this table,
[11:35] because Rails assumes you pretty much always want that.
[11:38] - That's a lie.
[11:39] I wish that Rails would just do timestamps by default
[11:41] and I had to say like opt out of timestamps,
[11:43] cause I always forget it for the first month.
[11:47] But you know what, a lot of people
[11:50] over the years have complained to various degree
[11:52] that Rails is too magic.
[11:54] But if you were really in the Ruby community,
[11:57] in the Rails community, no.
[11:58] You just didn't watch enough RailsCasts.
[12:00] That explains most of everything.
[12:01] (audience laughing)
[12:03] And that complaint is valid in that yeah,
[12:05] there was a ton of tribal knowledge.
[12:07] Ruby's dynamic, it was maybe under-documented.
[12:10] Things were definitely moving really, really fast.
[12:12] But there was an unintended side effect
[12:14] of all that tribal knowledge, which is that
[12:16] it forced us to create tribes.
[12:19] And I don't think that we really appreciate the fact
[12:21] that Ruby has more local meetups and regional conferences
[12:24] than any other language its size.
[12:26] And it's because the way that the language works
[12:29] and how all of our libraries are constructed
[12:31] require us to talk to each other.
[12:33] And I think that's really special.
[12:35] In fact, when I look back, there's something
[12:37] about Ruby, and the language and the tools
[12:40] and the community, that's just really, really kind
[12:42] and welcoming.
[12:43] And it's one facet I really appreciate.
[12:46] - In 2004, a blog post called Tour de Babel
[12:48] was written by Steve Yegge.
[12:50] And here's what he had to say about Ruby.
[12:52] "Ruby took Perl's string processing
[12:53] "and Unix integration as-is, meaning the syntax
[12:56] "is identical.
[12:57] "So right there, before anything else happens,
[12:59] "you already have the best of Perl.
[13:01] "And that's a great start, especially
[13:02] "if you don't take the Rest of Perl.
[13:03] (audience laughing)
[13:05] "But then Matz took the best of list processing from Lisp,
[13:08] "the best of OO from Smalltalk and other languages,
[13:10] "and the best of iterators from CLU,
[13:12] "and pretty much the best of everything from everyone.
[13:14] "And he somehow made it all work together
[13:16] "so well you don't even notice that it has all that stuff.
[13:20] "I learned Ruby faster than any language,
[13:23] "out of 30 or 40 total.
[13:24] "It took me about three days before I was more comfortable
[13:26] "using Ruby than I was in Perl,
[13:27] "after eight years of Perl hacking."
[13:31] - One of the things I've always loved about Ruby
[13:33] is that it has all of these features
[13:35] but constrains the developer with almost no rules
[13:39] as to how to use them.
[13:40] So it is dangerous.
[13:42] But it also trusts the developer to express themselves.
[13:44] And very few other languages, even the other hip
[13:47] and trendy languages of our day, check both of these boxes.
[13:50] I think Ruby stills stands out.
[13:52] - Next is MountainWest Ruby in 2008.
[13:54] Giles Bowkett is speaking here.
[13:56] - And that's Zed Shaw flipping off Giles.
[14:00] - One of the things that Ruby is famous for
[14:01] is metaprogramming, right, which is programming
[14:04] programming itself.
[14:05] But the thing is, that's not usually
[14:06] what we really do when we're doing metaprogramming,
[14:08] this magic, right?
[14:10] Because it's not metaprogramming.
[14:11] It's just programming.
[14:13] What we're really doing is metaOO.
[14:16] What it does is if you add a method to an object,
[14:18] it says, "I am in yourself, adding your name."
[14:21] Okay, I'm in your oatmeal, adding your cranberries.
[14:24] That's kind of eccentric.
[14:26] (audience laughing)
[14:28] - Giles is kind of eccentric.
[14:31] - I just took those, "I'm in your X adding your Y,"
[14:33] "I'm creating a new whatever,"
[14:35] I took that and I just changed it
[14:36] to return Ruby code, right?
[14:39] So now instead of printing random text
[14:41] to the screen like a log file,
[14:42] what it's doing is it's creating code.
[14:45] Now, there's no reason that you couldn't
[14:46] put executable code in a log file.
[14:50] When you run it, you end up with Python
[14:52] that populates a graph drawing program for Node Boxer,
[14:56] and this is what that graph looks like.
[14:58] And obviously, it is not stunning, right?
[15:00] It is not gorgeous.
[15:01] It is a simple object graph.
[15:04] Read this book, and I've only ever heard one
[15:07] other person or read one other person say that.
[15:09] The other person who said that is David Heinemeier Hansson.
[15:13] Now, the way this book starts
[15:14] is it starts with an EJB application, right?
[15:16] It was 2003.
[15:18] You've got a legacy app with 150 tables.
[15:22] You're using EJB, so you need seven files
[15:24] for every table that you wanna grok with your app.
[15:28] So that comes out, seven times 150,
[15:31] that comes out to 1,050 Java files, right?
[15:35] By hand, that takes a very long time to create.
[15:37] With generators, he created it very, very swiftly.
[15:42] Everybody who talks about Rails is,
[15:44] they're like, "magic makes programmers more productive."
[15:47] Bullshit, code generation makes programmers more productive.
[15:53] - Oh, we emailed Chad Fowler, too.
[15:56] And he's right there, and he also replied to our email.
[16:00] One of the kind of things that kept coming up
[16:02] is code generation.
[16:03] He had this to say: "And then I started doing stuff
[16:06] "like building DSLs to generate code,"
[16:08] in his case Java, "so I could write code in Ruby
[16:10] "and no one would have to know that it was Ruby.
[16:13] "It's true, everyone was doing code generation
[16:15] "in Ruby back then."
[16:16] And in the back of my mind, I'm just imagining
[16:18] how funny it is that before Rails,
[16:20] one of the core use cases for Ruby
[16:22] was to generate other programming language code
[16:24] so that people didn't have to know
[16:26] you were writing Ruby.
[16:28] And so we've come a long way.
[16:30] - Next up is Codemash in 2012,
[16:32] a talk given by Gary Bernhardt,
[16:34] the guy who sells screencasts at Destroy All Software.com.
[16:37] - And this is what his website looked like
[16:39] after he learned CSS.
[16:40] (audience laughing)
[16:43] - This has got to be one of the best lightning talks
[16:44] ever given, at least that I've watched.
[16:47] - [Gary] Let's talk about Ruby.
[16:49] (audience laughing)
[16:51] Ruby, unlike some other dynamic languages,
[16:53] does not have bare words.
[16:55] So you cannot just type words in and have strings come out,
[16:58] unless you define a particular method_missing
[17:01] that does the right thing.
[17:03] And then if you type bare words,
[17:05] suddenly Ruby supports bare words.
[17:07] And in fact, it will even support bare words
[17:08] with bangs in them.
[17:11] And this is not deserving of Wat.
[17:13] This is actually a result of how awesome Ruby is.
[17:16] (audience laughing)
[17:17] But if you ever actually do this, then wat.
[17:21] (audience laughing)
[17:24] - So looking back, clearly Ruby
[17:26] is a tremendously powerful language,
[17:28] and it's one of the hallmark facets
[17:29] of doing things just because you can.
[17:32] Even though there's sharp edges,
[17:33] not being afraid is really great.
[17:36] - Later in that email from Dave Thomas,
[17:38] he explained what it was like to get started
[17:39] with Ruby in 1998.
[17:42] He said, "I first came across Ruby in 1998.
[17:45] "You'd ftp a set of unencoded files,
[17:47] "concatenate them, and then uudecode that,
[17:50] "typically into a tar file.
[17:51] "You'd then run this through tar x
[17:53] "and start working on compiling.
[17:55] "Ruby had an autoconf file, which helped immensely,
[17:57] "and it would work out what libraries you were missing.
[17:59] "You then entered the recursive hell
[18:00] "of installing those, recursive because those libraries
[18:02] "would each have their own dependencies,
[18:04] "which you'd need to install, et cetera, et cetera.
[18:07] "To Matz's credit, Ruby was a fairly simple install.
[18:09] "I spent the rest of the day playing with it.
[18:11] "I think it was Ruby 1.2."
[18:13] - A fairly simple install, I want you to keep this
[18:15] in mind next time you wanna complain about rbenv,
[18:18] rvm, homebrew, or any of our fantastically convenient
[18:21] developer tools that we use today.
[18:23] - He continued, "I fell in love with the language.
[18:25] "I felt like it was something I'd been waiting for,
[18:27] "waiting for a long time.
[18:28] "At the time I was writing mostly C, Java, Perl,
[18:31] "and Ruby seemed to blow all them away.
[18:33] "It was easy to use classes, it had great defaults,
[18:35] "metaprogramming, whatever I threw at it, it shone."
[18:40] So apparently before 2005, it took longer than 15 minutes
[18:42] to build a blog.
[18:43] I had no idea.
[18:44] (audience laughing)
[18:46] Sounds awful.
[18:47] This is what Chad Fowler had to say
[18:48] about that time period.
[18:50] He said, "I remember more clearly
[18:52] "is the distinct difference between the Rails world
[18:54] "and the Ruby world, because when Rails came out,
[18:56] "David Heinemeier Hansson spoke at RubyConf 2004.
[18:59] "64 people in Chantilly, Virginia
[19:01] "in a Holiday Inn Select.
[19:02] "That was a big one for us.
[19:05] "He kept talking about ActionPack
[19:06] "and all these things I thought,
[19:07] "wow, these are really dumb-sounding names.
[19:11] "And he was just hyping the hell out of Rails
[19:13] "before it came out.
[19:14] "I thought, this is sort of silly,
[19:15] "because it's an MVC framework
[19:16] "in a language no one cared about."
[19:19] But here's that famous DHH Rails demo.
[19:23] - [Chad] Thing we do is called the Rails command
[19:25] to generate this skeleton of the application.
[19:27] So you saw it generated a bunch of things,
[19:30] a bunch of files, and then the next step,
[19:34] the very next step is starting the Ruby server.
[19:37] So seeing that everything works.
[19:39] The only prerequisite to this is that
[19:41] you have Ruby on Rails installed.
[19:44] Whups, it worked!
[19:46] (audience laughing)
[19:48] It's gonna say hello world.
[19:51] And we're gonna reload, and hello world!
[19:54] That's how much work you had to do
[19:55] to get to hello world.
[19:57] that's not a lot.
[19:59] Look at all the things I'm not doing.
[20:01] look at all the configurations I'm not writing.
[20:03] All these things are mapped together just automatically,
[20:06] just by saying blog up here
[20:08] maps directly to the blogging controller.
[20:10] And just by having index maps directly
[20:12] to the index template, hello world's a template.
[20:16] And now we even remove the action
[20:17] and saw that it could go all the way to the template
[20:19] without having an action.
[20:21] All right.
[20:22] Scaffolding is a way of easily putting
[20:25] a model object online in a way that you can edit it.
[20:29] Whups, we didn't create this.
[20:30] This was created for us just by this scaffolding thing.
[20:34] And the view is just mixing code and HTML,
[20:40] which seems like an old-fashioned way of doing things, but.
[20:45] - [Man] Kind of looks like JSX.
[20:47] - Yeah.
[20:49] - So Wups became its own Ruby meme around that time.
[20:54] It was a sort of Steve Jobs marketing tactics of DHH.
[20:57] Of course, the memes have been forgotten,
[20:58] cause Twitter hadn't been invented yet.
[21:00] (audience laughing)
[21:02] Chad also said this about his perspective of David
[21:04] at the time, which I love this.
[21:06] "He's young, and he's thrilled about this,
[21:08] "and he loves Ruby, and I see it.
[21:10] "he's found Ruby, and he's going
[21:11] "to change the world with it."
[21:12] And I'm not somebody who talks about
[21:14] changing the world very much.
[21:16] However, if you go and read the YouTube comments
[21:18] on that particular demo, which I did,
[21:20] (audience laughing)
[21:22] a relatively recent comment:
[21:23] "At the very beginning, I don't feel any surprise,
[21:25] "cause these are the common features
[21:26] "for every single framework in almost every language today.
[21:29] "But when I saw the date of publish,
[21:30] "oh my god, this video was published 11 years ago!"
[21:33] So I think crystallizes the entire impact
[21:36] that Ruby did change the world
[21:40] with David and Rails, because now the entire web
[21:42] works like this, and it's pretty amazing.
[21:45] But the Ruby world changed, too.
[21:47] One of the things that David told us was,
[21:49] "prior to Rails, people who used Ruby
[21:50] "were there because they liked the language and the people.
[21:53] "The pace of innovation was gentle,
[21:54] "as folks explored opportunities.
[21:56] "After Rails, the mood changed.
[21:58] "Now Ruby was there to solve a well-defined
[22:00] "and urgent need: writing web apps."
[22:03] And so the Daves teamed up and wrote
[22:04] Agile Web Development with Rails,
[22:06] through three editions and three major versions of Rails.
[22:09] And everywhere that I traveled,
[22:11] every software team that was doing Ruby
[22:12] had a bunch of these piled up.
[22:14] They were like an invaluable handbook.
[22:19] - So apparently RubyConf Hawaii was a thing,
[22:21] and I feel like we regressed a little bit.
[22:23] (audience laughing)
[22:27] There was a fantastic thing
[22:28] given by Ben Orenstein about refactoring.
[22:31] - I don't want you to think of this as a lecture.
[22:33] This isn't me standing here and telling you
[22:35] all these things that are absolute truth.
[22:38] Think of this as pairing.
[22:39] I am now pair programming with all of you.
[22:43] The first thing to notice is we've gone
[22:45] from one method with two lines
[22:47] to two methods with one line each.
[22:49] And I'm not gonna tell you that that's always
[22:51] an improvement, but it usually is.
[22:55] I'm starting to think, these days,
[22:57] that methods longer than a line are a code smell.
[23:01] When the code looks like this,
[23:03] for whatever reason, because we're programmers,
[23:04] because we read code, when we see code like this,
[23:07] we read it.
[23:09] So the first thing your eye does
[23:10] when you see, okay, orders_within_range equals,
[23:12] okay, let me figure out what this is.
[23:14] Let me figure out what this is doing.
[23:16] When it looks like this, when it's its own method,
[23:18] my eye is more likely to see orders_within_range,
[23:20] okay, that's just a private method.
[23:22] I'm just gonna assume that selects
[23:23] all the orders that are within the date range.
[23:25] What's it do next?
[23:28] Most intermediate object-oriented programmers
[23:30] are too reluctant to extract classes.
[23:34] The first rule of classes is
[23:36] that they should be very small.
[23:37] The second rule of classes is that
[23:39] they should be even smaller than that.
[23:41] (audience laughing)
[23:44] - In most companies, pair programming
[23:46] is a euphemism for co-located troubleshooting.
[23:49] (audience laughing)
[23:52] But something about the extreme programming roots
[23:55] of the Ruby community in the West
[23:57] means that most Ruby companies that I visit,
[24:00] that I work with, they actually pair program
[24:02] to learn and solve problems.
[24:03] And so don't think that Ben Orenstein
[24:05] read all of that advice in a book.
[24:07] No, he worked day in, day out,
[24:10] pair programming with other people
[24:11] and sharpening their craft.
[24:12] And that was really something special,
[24:13] something I really admire about the Ruby world.
[24:16] - Let's jump to 2007 and the release of Heroku.
[24:19] - One of the founders of Heroku, James Lindenbaum,
[24:21] said in an interview, "we disagree
[24:23] "that those new to Ruby and Rails
[24:25] "should have to go learn all the hard stuff.
[24:27] "It is the frameworks and the platforms
[24:29] "that need to shape up and make themselves
[24:30] "easier and more accessible."
[24:33] I'll never forget the first time my buddy Mark
[24:34] sat me down to deploy my first Rails app onto Heroku.
[24:38] I ran git push heroku, and then things happened,
[24:40] and I didn't have to configure anything,
[24:41] and it just worked.
[24:42] And it blew my mind.
[24:44] And nowadays, this sort of thing is normal.
[24:47] But in 2007 or whatever,
[24:48] that was really, really mindblowing.
[24:50] It was really rare.
[24:51] And Heroku was a product among a lot
[24:56] of other products that were built on top of Rails
[24:57] that just dispensed with this assumption
[25:01] that friction was okay and that pain was just
[25:04] a natural part of the development process.
[25:06] They were very allergic to any sort
[25:08] of extra friction that was being added
[25:10] to developers' workflow.
[25:12] And we all benefited from it.
[25:14] So when you look back, especially with Rails,
[25:16] but at some point, Ruby became a massively
[25:19] productive language as well.
[25:21] And I think that high productivity
[25:23] is still a hallmark of lots of Ruby teams.
[25:25] - Next up is RubyConf San Francisco in 2009,
[25:28] where Ryan Davis and Aaron Patterson
[25:30] showed us that co-presenting is a really, really bad idea.
[25:33] (audience laughing)
[25:36] - What we need is to be able to figure out
[25:38] how to identify a bad idea.
[25:40] We came up with this field guide.
[25:41] First and foremost, it needs to be well engineered
[25:43] and tested.
[25:44] It needs to be useless-ish.
[25:46] It needs to follow Poe's law.
[25:48] And it needs to have a spiral nature,
[25:49] or what we call whups.
[25:52] (audience laughing)
[25:54] - Ruby, we all know and love, is slow.
[25:57] C is not.
[25:58] But why would you write in C when you can write in assembly?
[26:00] (audience laughing)
[26:02] An example of some inline C for a method called C
[26:05] that counts from zero to N plus one
[26:09] and returns the result.
[26:11] Now, this needs to be as fast as possible.
[26:12] There are a lot of webpages that have to do
[26:14] this type of counting.
[26:15] (audience laughing)
[26:16] So we write this is C so that our webpages are fast.
[26:20] Now, as is obvious,
[26:23] (audience laughing)
[26:25] we can see that this assembly code
[26:26] does the exact same thing.
[26:29] - [Aaron] Oh, I knew that, obvious.
[26:32] - So really what we need to compare is the benchmarks.
[26:35] (audience laughing)
[26:36] And as you can see here-
[26:37] - Look at that, wow!
[26:38] - [Ryan] They're almost exactly the same time.
[26:40] - I'm blown away.
[26:42] (audience laughing)
[26:44] Phuby is a PHP runtime embedded in Ruby.
[26:49] (audience laughing)
[26:53] I've written a couple web adaptors,
[26:54] one for WEBRick, cause of course
[26:56] this PHP runtime isn't useful unless we can run,
[26:59] say, WordPress, right?
[27:02] I'm starting up Phrack here down at the bottom,
[27:04] in case you can't read.
[27:05] That starts up WEBRick on port LOLOL.
[27:07] (audience laughing)
[27:12] So we access that, create our little configuration file,
[27:16] and whups, we have a freakin blog.
[27:19] (audience laughing)
[27:27] The correct pronunciation here is "Pooby on Fails."
[27:31] (audience laughing)
[27:35] All right, all right.
[27:38] So we're gonna start up, this is a normal Rails project.
[27:41] So we're gonna generate, oh, in Rails,
[27:44] everything's plural.
[27:45] So we generate the PHPs controller to control it, right?
[27:47] (audience laughing)
[27:50] I suppose I could've named that codes,
[27:51] but I don't know if you can consider it code.
[27:53] So we opened up index.php.
[27:55] (audience laughing)
[27:58] So we do the PHP info.
[28:00] I just learned that the other day, total, serious.
[28:04] So port 3,000, hit localhost, port 3,000,
[28:08] the PHPs controller, and we're running that.
[28:10] (audience laughing) (applause)
[28:14] - There is a lesson.
[28:15] What Ryan is showing us is speed is important, yes.
[28:18] But it's one of many factors.
[28:20] There are trade offs, like readability and writability.
[28:22] And it's just the case that Ruby
[28:24] makes a lot of those trade off decisions,
[28:26] just like Matz was talking about this morning,
[28:28] in a way that suits a lot of real-world problems
[28:30] just fine the way it is.
[28:32] And what Aaron showed us is that just because
[28:34] something has no practical use doesn't mean
[28:36] that it was useless to build it.
[28:39] Maybe it was just simply entertaining to build
[28:41] a PHP runtime in Ruby.
[28:43] But it was probably also a good challenge.
[28:45] And it definitely taught us all a lot,
[28:48] a little, it taught us a little.
[28:49] (audience laughing)
[28:51] - Meanwhile, in Orlando, Envy Labs,
[28:53] now Code School, was creating Rails for Zombies.
[28:57] - [Voiceover] So you're probably wondering
[28:58] what is Rails for Zombies?
[28:59] Well, the short answer is that it's an interactive tutorial
[29:01] to teach the basics of web application development
[29:03] in the browser using Ruby on Rails.
[29:05] But here's the long answer.
[29:07] In the world of technical learning,
[29:08] you've got books and you've got screencasts,
[29:10] neither of which has any interactivity.
[29:12] But come on, this is the Nintendo generation.
[29:14] Give me a damn joystick.
[29:17] (upbeat music)
[29:18] - [Singer] Zombie brains and you're entranced.
[29:20] Time to stop and learn some Rails,
[29:23] cause we got something new to grab.
[29:26] Rails for Zombies by Envy Labs.
[29:30] (audience laughing)
[29:31] - In this tutorial, we're gonna be building
[29:33] a web application somewhat like Twitter,
[29:36] except it's going to be Twitter for zombies.
[29:42] (audience laughing)
[29:44] - So it was a little quirky, but I remember
[29:45] this was so cool, typing code into the browser,
[29:48] and then you push enter, and it's like, whoa,
[29:49] Josh, you did it, good job,
[29:51] and feeling so successful from that.
[29:54] - And especially in an industry
[29:55] that just takes itself way too damn seriously
[29:58] most of the time, it is something
[30:00] I really love about educators in the Ruby community
[30:04] who are willing to have a little bit of fun
[30:05] and try to find engaging ways to teach people programming.
[30:09] And the Code School stuff and Rails for Zombies
[30:11] was a great example of that.
[30:12] By the way, there are zombie emoji now,
[30:15] as of like a couple weeks ago.
[30:16] And so I had to put one in my talk.
[30:18] (audience laughing)
[30:19] And that's all that slide is for.
[30:20] - Now for some synergy.
[30:22] In 2004, why was writing his guide to Ruby,
[30:25] which was just this, oh, and also
[30:28] you can buy this on Amazon now,
[30:29] in a physical copy, so go do that, I guess.
[30:33] This book was just so interesting.
[30:36] He mixed blocks of code with all of these comics
[30:39] in such a creative and fascinating way.
[30:41] And he had amazing ways to show off
[30:43] different code structures.
[30:46] So take a look at this method invocation here.
[30:49] And so this is how why explains this.
[30:51] He said, "think of it as an inner tube
[30:53] "the method is pulling along,
[30:54] "containing its extra instructions.
[30:56] "The parentheses form the wet,
[30:58] "well-rounded edges of the inner tube.
[30:59] "The commas are the feet of each argument
[31:02] "sticking over the edge."
[31:04] So I've never thought of that,
[31:05] but I will never forget that inner tube now.
[31:07] (audience laughing)
[31:10] - And some people didn't like the kitschy
[31:12] chunky bacon thing, you know, they hate fun.
[31:16] But it's almost as if why was prescient
[31:19] and could see that coming, cause at the end of the chapter,
[31:21] the same foxes say, "the only thing the world
[31:24] "will know me for is chunky bacon."
[31:27] And they're all sad and dejected,
[31:29] which is, in hindsight, a really sad slide.
[31:33] (audience laughing)
[31:34] But the first thing that I encountered
[31:35] that why built was Try Ruby.
[31:38] It was an online REPL that taught you
[31:40] a little bit of Ruby in a 15-minute tutorial.
[31:42] And nowadays, with our modern browsers
[31:44] and these really fantastic JavaScript consoles,
[31:46] it doesn't sound that amazing.
[31:48] But at the time, it would send Ruby
[31:50] up to a server and put it in jail.
[31:51] It was a really, really terrific
[31:53] little way to show people Ruby
[31:54] without having to install it.
[31:56] And another one of why's projects is still alive.
[31:59] Shoes is a GUI desktop toolkit
[32:02] for building cross-platform apps with Ruby.
[32:05] And Shoes 4 is a release candidate I think right now,
[32:07] and tomorrow morning Jason Clark is giving a talk
[32:10] about Shoes and how to use it.
[32:12] So I encourage you to go if you're interested.
[32:15] - In the forward to the PickAxe book, Matz writes this.
[32:19] He says, "man is driven to create.
[32:21] "I know I really do love to create things.
[32:23] "and while I'm not good at painting
[32:24] "or drawing or music, I can write software."
[32:28] - And there's a reason that we made Phuby on Phails
[32:33] and no one in PHP made, oh, they made Django.
[32:38] (audience laughing)
[32:40] Anyway, my point is the Ruby community's really
[32:42] creative, in hindsight.
[32:45] - This one is fantastic.
[32:46] Ruby Hoedown, 2008, Bryan Liles
[32:48] is talking about testing here.
[32:52] - Asking yourself, "where do I start?"
[32:54] And I'm gonna say test all the fucking time, first.
[32:56] But then I'm gonna say you just start at the beginning.
[33:00] The bible says, "in the beginning."
[33:01] And in the beginning, there was what?
[33:03] - [Audience Member] God!
[33:04] - No, there was Perl.
[33:05] (audience laughing)
[33:15] Today I'll talk about BDD with RSpec,
[33:17] but I like to change things around,
[33:18] so let's just talk about BDD.
[33:20] Or really, let's just talk about testing
[33:21] for us normal people.
[33:23] And the real thing that I'm trying to get
[33:24] out to everyone here is you should
[33:26] be testing all the fucking time.
[33:30] I fell into testing, and this is with good old JUnit.
[33:33] And I thought I was doing real good here.
[33:35] But there was a problem.
[33:37] Wow, problem was I was writing bad, brittle tests.
[33:40] And my tests had no organization.
[33:43] And I wasn't using any type of conventions.
[33:45] All my tests looked different every single time.
[33:48] And really I was confused, all over the place.
[33:52] Describe what the code should do
[33:54] rather than describing what it does.
[33:56] And whenever I realized this, I actually,
[33:58] it's like it was a moment for me.
[34:00] And it was like I reached zen.
[34:03] And remember, test all the fucking time.
[34:05] and I can't say this enough.
[34:06] And really this is what I want everyone to say.
[34:08] When I hear Ruby, I want you to say,
[34:09] "test all the fucking time, yeah!"
[34:11] (audience laughing)
[34:14] I'm gonna leave you guys with one thought.
[34:16] "Do not try to imitate the old masters.
[34:20] "Seek what they sought."
[34:22] And this is something that I live my life by.
[34:24] And I wanna leave you with one more thing.
[34:26] (audience laughing)
[34:29] - So again, I think there's something special
[34:31] about the Extreme Programming roots in this community,
[34:34] combined with the massive popularity of Rails,
[34:37] where Ruby really in many ways
[34:38] became the first mainstream language
[34:41] to normalize the idea that you should test your code.
[34:44] And not only test-driven development
[34:47] and behavior-driven development,
[34:48] but for me, working on a Java team,
[34:50] Ruby really made testing cool.
[34:52] We were seriously jealous.
[34:53] Testing was this drudgery that I had to do
[34:55] as a Java programmer, and QA people
[34:57] were treated like second-class citizens.
[34:59] I think that the testing is part of Ruby's history,
[35:02] and it really, really helped push the industry forward.
[35:06] - Jump to RailsConf Chicago in 2014.
[35:09] Sandi Metz is talking about making small things here.
[35:13] - May have noticed some principles.
[35:15] And they developed a style guide
[35:18] about how to organize code.
[35:21] That's what object-oriented design is.
[35:23] That's what the rules of object-oriented design are.
[35:25] It's a style guide about how to organize code,
[35:28] with all the obvious trade offs,
[35:30] all the places where you can make your own decisions.
[35:34] This is the squint test.
[35:36] (audience laughing)
[35:38] Here's how it works.
[35:39] You squint your eyes, and you lean back,
[35:42] and you look at the code.
[35:44] And we're looking for changes in shape.
[35:47] (audience laughing)
[35:50] And changes in color.
[35:53] Changes in shape mean you have nested conditionals,
[35:55] and they are always gonna be hard to reason about.
[35:58] Changes in color mean that your code
[35:59] is at differing levels of abstraction.
[36:03] Here we have, this is the code we just wrote.
[36:05] And this is the squint test version.
[36:06] Don't try to read it.
[36:07] It's code we just wrote on the right.
[36:08] This is how we started on the left.
[36:10] You notice that the shape is flat
[36:13] and the colors are starting to cluster.
[36:16] Tidbeck, who has a wonderfully succint way to put this.
[36:19] He says, "make the change easy; this might be hard.
[36:23] "And then make the easy change."
[36:25] People ask me now, when people ask me
[36:27] how to write object-oriented code,
[36:28] I tell them, I give them one small piece of advice.
[36:32] I say, "make smaller things."
[36:35] - So I remember back in like 2005,
[36:38] when a lot of my Ruby friends were arrogantly laughing
[36:40] at my abstract context factory springbeam stuff
[36:44] and all these heavyweight design patterns in Java land
[36:48] because they didn't need that,
[36:49] cause Ruby was simple and straightforward.
[36:51] And then to watch Sandi's book take off,
[36:53] and then in like 2014 all of these Rails developers
[36:56] trying to jam factory classes into their Rails apps
[36:59] was a special kind of pleasure for me.
[37:02] (audience laughing)
[37:02] But to be honest, I think that POODR and teaching
[37:05] and mainstreaming object-oriented design
[37:08] to so many people was really a mark of maturity
[37:12] for applications built with Ruby and Rails.
[37:15] - Next is Ruby Midwest in 2013.
[37:17] Jessica Kerr absolutely blew my mind
[37:18] with this talk on functional programming.
[37:20] - Functional programming is a lot about that.
[37:23] It's about all the things we don't have to think about
[37:27] so we can think about what's right in front of us.
[37:29] And that becomes really important
[37:31] as our applications get larger and more feature-rich.
[37:35] And they don't fit all in one person's head anymore.
[37:39] You have to be able to put most of the application
[37:41] out of your head and zoom in on what's right in front of you
[37:45] in order to solve these problems effectively.
[37:49] I hear from people who've gone from .NET to Ruby
[37:53] is that Ruby developers have a lot of discipline
[37:56] compared to Java and .NET programmers,
[37:58] that we, programming Ruby, impose discipline
[38:02] on our code.
[38:04] And we do that through idiomatic practices
[38:07] and just avoiding the sticky bits.
[38:10] And we can choose to follow the same functional principles
[38:15] that Haskell imposes on its developers.
[38:18] We can do that of our own choice.
[38:20] Ruby development is consensual.
[38:22] (audience laughing)
[38:25] So The Ruby community has taught the Java community
[38:28] a crapload of stuff about unit testing
[38:31] and how useful it is.
[38:32] Here's something the Java community can give back.
[38:35] If you have to overwrite methods
[38:36] or inject private states or in any way
[38:39] get around the simple stuff that you would do
[38:42] in production code in order to test an object,
[38:45] your object's wrong, your design is poor.
[38:49] Realize that nil is not data.
[38:53] So the problem with nil is it has 16 different meanings.
[38:57] It means false, it means crap, I screwed something up,
[39:00] it means not applicable.
[39:02] In a hash, it could mean key not found,
[39:04] or it could mean the key contains nil.
[39:08] And when it can mean 16 different things,
[39:10] it means nothing.
[39:15] - So when I was in college, the idea
[39:17] of functional programming was like this ivory tower,
[39:21] faux academic nonsense that was really full
[39:24] of mathematical notation and people
[39:26] puffing their chest, pretending they're smarter
[39:27] than everyone else.
[39:28] How most of us in this room learned functional programming
[39:31] is cause Matz thought that these were cool functions
[39:33] to throw on innumerable and wanted to teach them
[39:35] to people to be useful.
[39:37] And so I feel like Ruby was a great gateway drug
[39:40] to real, blue-collar functional programming
[39:43] and popularized in the way that academia had failed.
[39:48] - This is the only talk that we're gonna
[39:49] present today that wasn't presented
[39:50] at a Ruby-specific conference.
[39:51] But it was given by Jim Weirich,
[39:53] so we'll give it a pass.
[39:57] - Okay, so what does it mean?
[39:58] Connascence itself means let's talk
[39:59] about the common birth of two or more things
[40:01] at the same time and the production
[40:03] of two things that tend to grow together,
[40:05] that tend to stay the same.
[40:08] So connascence in software
[40:12] are those things that need to change together.
[40:17] So what is name connascence?
[40:19] Suppose you have a definition of a method here called foo,
[40:22] and then we call foo over here.
[40:24] This is connascence of name,
[40:26] because if I decide to change the name
[40:27] of my method foo, I obviously have to change
[40:31] the name of every place where foo is called.
[40:35] Variable where it's defined, and the title
[40:37] has to be there, and the address has to be there.
[40:40] So if I were to change the order
[40:42] of my parameters in this list,
[40:44] I would have to change the order of every place
[40:48] that was called to match the changing of order.
[40:53] Why is connascence important?
[40:55] Change is expensive.
[40:57] It's good software practice to reduce the coupling
[41:00] between your modules.
[41:03] And connascence is a way of talking
[41:05] about coupling in a particular way.
[41:09] One of these displays is exactly like the first one,
[41:12] displays all the methods available
[41:14] for the Fixnum class.
[41:16] The other one displays all the methods
[41:17] defined explicitly in the Fixnum
[41:20] but not in the ancestors of Fixnum.
[41:25] Which one is which?
[41:29] Okay, first one's all the way up.
[41:31] How do you remember that?
[41:32] Cause please tell me.
[41:33] (laughs) You just looked it up, okay.
[41:35] I did too, yeah.
[41:36] Since i just looked it up for this talk, I know.
[41:39] But I forget it every single time.
[41:41] This is connascence of meaning.
[41:43] We have assigned a particular meaning
[41:45] to the values true and false
[41:46] that is not evident from their usage right here.
[41:53] Actions, reduce the degree of connascence in your code,
[41:57] increase locality.
[41:58] And things that need to change together,
[42:00] put them in the same module.
[42:01] Bring them closer together so they can change
[42:03] together more easily.
[42:05] And don't repeat yourself is kind of
[42:07] an application of increasing locality.
[42:12] Single responsibility principle
[42:14] also moves in that direction.
[42:16] So it think these things are kind of based
[42:18] upon the locality idea in connascence.
[42:22] - So that's what coupling means.
[42:24] For me, that word just meant nothing until
[42:26] I saw that talk, and Jim explained coupling
[42:28] through the term connascence.
[42:31] It makes me really sad to even have to share
[42:34] that Jim passed away a few years ago.
[42:37] But he meant so much to the Ruby community
[42:41] from its heady XP days and from the year 2000 onward
[42:45] to kind of shepherding so many of us through
[42:47] how to build solid, awesome Ruby code
[42:51] that if you go to his last commit on GitHub,
[42:54] some of you might not know this,
[42:55] there's thousands of comments thanking Jim
[42:56] for his contributions.
[42:58] And somewhere in some GitHub.com template
[42:59] is an if-else conditional to print
[43:01] this thank you message.
[43:04] We recommend you go back and watch
[43:05] all of Jim's old talks.
[43:06] And if you do and you appreciate it,
[43:08] we encourage you to contribute to the Weirich Fund,
[43:10] to the scholarship program that's trying
[43:13] to keep Jim's memory alive and also help
[43:15] more people find the joys in the computer science
[43:18] that he did.
[43:21] So clearly, Ruby's a really thoughtful language.
[43:24] We spend a lot of time at conferences
[43:25] talking about ways that we can get better at our craft.
[43:30] - At RubyConf Charlotte in 2007,
[43:33] Marcel Molina gave a fantastic talk about beauty.
[43:38] - There's something deeper than just appearances
[43:42] that actually dictates what makes something beautiful
[43:45] versus not beautiful.
[43:51] The first topic that he brings up is proportion.
[43:55] The next piece is integrity.
[43:59] Third is clarity, and clarity is a simple concept.
[44:04] It's something is clear, and something is simple.
[44:08] That's a simple working definition
[44:11] for what makes something beautiful.
[44:12] Those three parts.
[44:14] Now, we're gonna apply that to a piece of software
[44:16] to see how this can actually relate
[44:18] to code that we write.
[44:22] Can choose one or two.
[44:24] They're intended to all work in concert.
[44:27] And they balance each other out.
[44:29] So they're each necessary, but none of them are sufficient.
[44:33] I don't know if he uses the word beauty anywhere
[44:36] in the entire book.
[44:39] But if you look at the information he gives you
[44:44] and you think about the three principles of beauty,
[44:47] almost every piece of information in that book
[44:50] is driving you towards fulfilling
[44:53] one or more of the three principles
[44:57] that go to our working definition of beauty.
[45:01] So he's setting out to write a book
[45:04] about how to write great software.
[45:06] And it turns out that all the software
[45:08] that you create following those principles
[45:12] is also, by this definition of beauty,
[45:15] beautiful software.
[45:19] Lucky for us, Ruby is optimized for beauty, big time.
[45:26] I'd like to finish just by thanking
[45:28] Matz and the Ruby core team
[45:30] for writing what I think is the most beautiful
[45:32] language I've ever used.
[45:35] So I'd like to thank Matz.
[45:36] Give him and applause.
[45:37] (applause)
[45:42] - So it's no secret, surrounding yourself
[45:45] with beautiful code will lead to happy developers.
[45:48] I think it also stands to reason
[45:49] that happy developers make more progress faster.
[45:52] Ask your manager, more progress will lead
[45:55] to more money.
[45:56] And so through the transitive property,
[45:58] this is not like hippy-dippy bullshit.
[46:01] Beautiful code leads to more money.
[46:03] There, I proved it.
[46:04] (audience laughing)
[46:05] So this is actually really valuable stuff.
[46:07] - In a interview with O'Reilly in 2001,
[46:10] Matz was asked the following.
[46:12] "Did you have a guiding philosophy
[46:13] "when designing Ruby?"
[46:15] He replied, "yes, it's called the principle
[46:17] "of least surprise.
[46:18] "I believe people want to express themselves
[46:20] "when they program.
[46:21] "They don't want to fight with the language."
[46:23] - First day at my first programming internship,
[46:25] the first piece of advice I got
[46:27] was that there's no such thing as a good surprise.
[46:29] And what the person was talking about
[46:31] was even with great tools,
[46:34] it's predictable tools that enable flow.
[46:36] And even a good surprise can break you out of it.
[46:39] - At Cascadia Ruby in 2012,
[46:42] Katrina Owen gave a fantastic talk
[46:44] about how refactoring brings joy.
[46:48] - Taken to coming into the office
[46:49] early in the morning and committing
[46:51] random acts of refactoring.
[46:54] Some people are calling this guilt-driven development.
[46:56] (audience laughing)
[46:58] But really it's not.
[47:00] Refactoring just makes me happy.
[47:04] I found this particular specimen
[47:06] in the dark recesses of that code base.
[47:09] It had no tests, and there was no documentation.
[47:15] Where do you even begin testing
[47:16] something like this?
[47:20] We don't really know what the inputs look like.
[47:24] We certainly don't know what the output looks like.
[47:27] We do know that it's in production
[47:29] and it appears to be working,
[47:30] because we haven't had any complaints
[47:31] from the customer about it.
[47:33] (audience laughing)
[47:37] The easiest way to discover inputs
[47:38] is to just send something, anything really,
[47:41] into the method, and then see what comes back out.
[47:46] We took a piece of undocumented, untested code,
[47:50] and with a bit of hand-waving,
[47:52] we got fake assertions to give us the inputs.
[47:56] The inputs gave us the outputs,
[47:58] and the outputs gave us the real assertions.
[48:03] Perfect? Of course not.
[48:05] Is it better?
[48:06] Hell yeah.
[48:09] We went from this to this in less than 30 steps.
[48:14] I started optimizing for happiness.
[48:18] I would specifically put something
[48:20] into its own class just so that I could load
[48:21] just that class and nothing else.
[48:24] The feedback loop you get when you have
[48:26] sub-second test suites for the thing
[48:28] that you're working on is unbelievable.
[48:31] It's a huge enabler for flow.
[48:37] - Along the same lines of the emotional layer
[48:39] of productivity with software,
[48:41] Kent Beck at RailsConf a couple years ago
[48:43] in Atlanta shared this.
[48:45] - Those emotions are valuable information.
[48:47] Emotions are noisy information,
[48:49] but they're valuable information.
[48:51] And that feeling of "I'm proud of this" means something.
[48:55] And that feeling like, "oh, I hope nobody
[48:56] "ever looks inside this file,"
[48:59] that also means something.
[49:01] (audience laughing)
[49:03] - Remember that email from Dave Thomas earlier?
[49:04] Yes, that's Dave Thomas.
[49:06] This is how he closed it.
[49:07] He said, "I'm grateful for the excitement
[49:08] "that surrounds Ruby, that keeps it fresh and growing.
[49:11] "I'm happy for the folks who found a home here.
[49:13] "Programming is difficult, and programmers deserve
[49:15] "to use the tools that they love."
[49:18] - So one of my favorite aspects of Ruby
[49:20] is the pursuit of joy and programmer happiness and delight.
[49:26] I'd love for you to look up Ruby Koans
[49:29] at some point soon.
[49:31] Work through those exercises.
[49:32] They're great.
[49:33] Start a Ruby Quiz club with some friends
[49:35] and play through some of the old example quizzes there.
[49:39] Go on Exorcism, go through the Ruby exercises
[49:41] so that you can go and comment
[49:42] and help other people who are trying to learn Ruby.
[49:45] We've only covered 12 talks.
[49:46] There's 2172 to go.
[49:47] So you got some homework for yourself.
[49:50] Would love, like, think about the date
[49:52] you started using Ruby.
[49:53] And then use Google advanced search
[49:54] and go look for some Ruby blog stuff.
[49:56] See what people were talking about
[49:58] in our community before you joined.
[50:00] And our message to you is we want you
[50:02] to go do something that makes you want to say, "wups!"
[50:06] Cause the last facet of Ruby's future
[50:07] is really gonna be determined by people
[50:09] like you, in this room.
[50:11] So yeah, we work for Test Double.
[50:12] We're an agency.
[50:13] We're way over time.
[50:15] We'd love for you to join the team, at that URL.
[50:18] Like I said, all these links are gonna be up
[50:19] at our blog in just a little bit here.
[50:22] And thank you so much for sitting through with us.
[50:24] (applause)
