This talk, as delivered at [ScotlandJS](http://www.scotlandjs.com) in Edinburgh, Scotland,
is the snappy, 20 minute version of my hour-long talk of the same name. If you like
punchy sweeping generalizations and rapid-fire slide transitions, this one may better
suit you than the [long-form version](/posts/2013-10-03-javascript-testing-tactics.html).

The goal of this presentation is to impart some lessons about unit testing JavaScript
that one may find counter-intuitive, not obvious, or poorly documented by the community.
It covers a handful of tactics to employ when writing tests for (particularly, front-end)
JavaScript applications, as well as much context behind those techniques as I could
possibly cram into its 20 minute run-time.

The slides, as always, are hosted on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/searls/javascript-testing-tactics-lightning-edition):
