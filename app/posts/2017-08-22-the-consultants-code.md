Sound familiar? If any of these statements resonates with you then you've most likely been in the shoes of the person making the statement _or_ as a consultant engaged with a client in a similar predicament. The phrase "Software Consulting" generally evokes feelings of **praise** or **disdain**, or perhaps both depending on the circumstances. As consultants, we are often positioned as experts and typically engaged during times of crisis or uncertainty; so it should come as no surprise that our ability to deliver in the midst of that environment is the primary measure of our effectiveness.

Expectations about what we are hired to deliver generally set the scale by which we are judged; frequently that involves analysis, reporting, recommendations but also training, mentoring, and code. The world is a big enough place that it's plausible to think of a scenario where the opening statements above were made by someone dealing with the aftermath of a poor experience with a previous software consultancy, typically measured by the state or quality of "the code". While it would be interesting to attempt an objective look at what typifies "quality" as it relates to "code", I think there is a _more_ interesting vector to approach the quality valuation that also pertains to "code" of a different kind; call it the code of conduct, or the way we interact with our clients as consultants, or perhaps even our ability to relate and help them rise out of the midst of chaos and uncertainty -- this type of consultants code is less frequently explored, which is a shame, because I firmly believe it has a more direct impact on the physical code we write than our technical expertise.

## Hostile Takeover

Consultants in any industry are often vilified from the start of an engagement due to a perceived "us vs them" mentality. Depending on the how the engagement was initiated, trust was likely extended from key decision makers but generally does _not_ extend from the rank and file employees of the company. This puts an immediate burden of responsibility on the consultant to become adept at earning that trust inclusively and discerning barriers which would prevent that from happening.
