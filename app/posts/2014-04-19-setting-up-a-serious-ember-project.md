This is the first edition in what I hope will be a multi-part series covering [Ember](http://emberjs.com).
In this screencast, I give some background information on who and how this screencast might help you get started
with using Ember to build real production applications.

A big part of the learning curve to Ember is in the setup. What's important to me is to find a way to
 separate my front-end & back-end codebases without inconveniencing my development workflow. As a result,
 this guide will show you how to build an Ember project with [Lineman](http://linemanjs.com) that proxies API requests back to a
 separate [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) application which will provide a
 [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) using
 [ActiveModel::Serializers](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers).
